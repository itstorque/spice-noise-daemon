# spice-noise-daemon
Noise Component Generator and Entropy Daemon for LTSpice

Daemon creates .asy and .lib files. Run in directory of a project and use components as a voltage/current source.
Change what noise sources are in the `noise/noise_sources.yaml` file.
Running the daemon in live mode adds entropy between runs to rewrite csv based on noise
distribution defined in the yaml file.

Add to path so you can run it anywhere using:
`sudo ln -s $PWD/spice_noise.py /usr/local/bin/spicenoise`

Then you can run 
`spicenoise -s file.asc` anywhere to set up a new noise
simulation.

Edit `noise/noise_sources.yaml` to generate a new noise source.

Run `spicenoise file.asc` (by default runs with the `-g` and `-n` flags)
to generate the components and launch a daemon. Now you can insert
noise components in LTSpice from your component library and everytime you run
the daemon ensures a new random sequence is generated by your noise source
that follows the distribution defined in `noise/noise_sources.yaml`.
